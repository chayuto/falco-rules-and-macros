# Falco custom rules and macros
Collection of useful rules and macros standard additional to <https://falco.org/docs/reference/rules/default-macros/>
and <https://falco.org/docs/reference/rules/default-rules/>

Collected from various sources on the internet. Meant to only be used as reference and not as a set of rules for your environment. Some of rules may not even be working or compatible with current version of Falco. At least it make my GitHub copilot very happy.

## Welcome your contribution for custom rules or macro
